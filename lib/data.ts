      (Please send me an email, so I can setup an test account with your specific knowledge base.) Architected and led the development of a sophisticated RAG AI application hosted on Google Cloud Platform, leveraging Firestore for robust data management of user documents, including chat history and configurations. Pioneered a system allowing
users to upload and selectively merge documents to form a dynamic knowledge base, optimizing the AI's response capabilities.
Implemented Cloud Storage solutions for efficient indexing, utilizing both OpenAI and HuggingFace Embeddings for local and remote
processing. Designed and integrated an intuitive user interface, facilitating seamless user interactions and document management, which
significantly enhances the usability and accessibility of AI-driven data retrieval and analysis. This project underscores my expertise in AI
application development, cloud architecture, and user-centric design, contributing significantly to advancing AI accessibility and
functionality in practical applications. `,

    title: "JNI Global References Are Still Vulnerable: Attacks and Defenses",
    description: `System services and resources in Android are accessed through IPC-based mechanisms. Previous research has demonstrated that they are vulnerable to the denial-of-service attack (DoS attack). For instance, the JNI global reference (JGR), which is widely used by system services, can be exhausted to cause the system reboot (hence the name JGRE attack). Even though the Android team tries to fix the problem by enforcing security checks, we find that it is still possible to construct a JGR exhaustion DoS attack in the latest Android system. In this article, we propose a new JGR exhaustion DoS attack, which is effective in different Android versions, including the latest one (i.e., Android 10). Specifically, we developed JGREAnalyzer, a tool that can systematically detect JGR vulnerable services APIs via a call graph analysis and a forwarding reachability analysis. We applied this tool to different Android versions and found multiple vulnerabilities. In particular, among 148 system services in Android 10, 12 of them have 21 vulnerabilities. Among them, 9 can be successfully exploited without any permissions. We further analyze the root cause of the vulnerabilities and propose a new defense to mitigate the JGRE attack by restricting resource consumption via global reference counting.`,
