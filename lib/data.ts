    description:`
      Architected and led the development of a sophisticated RAG AI application hosted on Google Cloud Platform, leveraging Firestore for robust data management of user documents, including chat history and configurations. Pioneered a system allowing
users to upload and selectively merge documents to form a dynamic knowledge base, optimizing the AI's response capabilities.
Implemented Cloud Storage solutions for efficient indexing, utilizing both OpenAI and HuggingFace Embeddings for local and remote
processing. Designed and integrated an intuitive user interface, facilitating seamless user interactions and document management, which
significantly enhances the usability and accessibility of AI-driven data retrieval and analysis. This project underscores my expertise in AI
application development, cloud architecture, and user-centric design, contributing significantly to advancing AI accessibility and
functionality in practical applications. (Please send me an email, so I can setup an test account with your specific knowledge base.)`
